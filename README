Small project to create a lauch hub around TV programs from a TV channel
The program guide is retrived from http://services.vrt.be/epg/schedules/today?channel_code=O8 as a json file.
A python script on appengine transform the json into HTML.
The intention is to gain some experience with mobile webapps and responsive design.
The HTML5 is derived from the mobile boilerplate: http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile

The documentation about the program guide can be found here: http://services.vrt.be/doc/
